# Udacity-neural-networks-basics

## Created for basic understanding of neural network inspired from Deeplearning Nanodegree program from Udacity.

Here we have two folders:

  1.gradient-descent
  
  2.student-admissions
  
First one gradient-descent gives an easy intuition about how to apply gradient descent algorithm in making neural networks.
Second folder gives a basic intro to your first neural network training.

Hope it helps you guys!!
